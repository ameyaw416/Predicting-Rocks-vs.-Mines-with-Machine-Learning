Building a Machine Learning model is always a journey of discovery—and I’m excited to share the results of my latest project! 

Using a dataset of sonar signals (200 rows and 61 features), I developed a Logistic Regression model to predict whether an object detected underwater is a rock or a mine. Here’s how it performed:

Training Data Accuracy: 83%
Test Data Accuracy: 76%

While some might wonder about the difference in accuracy scores, it’s essential to understand this is completely normal for a dataset of this size and complexity. With only 200 samples to train and evaluate the model, 
slight variations in performance are expected when generalizing to unseen data.

What this means:
The model is learning well from the available data, and the test accuracy reflects its ability to handle real-world scenarios. With a larger dataset, even greater accuracy and robustness could be achieved!

Key Takeaway:
Even with limited data, Machine Learning can unlock powerful insights. This project demonstrates the potential of ML in applications like marine exploration, defense, and environmental monitoring.
